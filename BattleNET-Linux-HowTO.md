# How to install and configure Battle.NET on Linux
* Install `Lutris`
* Create a separate folder for games outside of BattleNET bottle
* Configure `Flatseal` to give permissions for both folders with read + write
* Attach a separate drive in `Lutris` via Wine configuration
* Install `Battle.NET`
* Switch default directory and scan for games in the mounted drive
* It is recommended to use `Proton GE 9-24` since all of the games work there.
* Select Windows 10 as a Windows version.
* If you don't experience any problems - don't disable `browser hardware acceleration` in Battle.NET
