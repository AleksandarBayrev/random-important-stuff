# Open `Best CS2 Launch Options 2023 Guide, Setting List for FPS.html` to see some optimizations for CS 2 if needed.

# Use these launch options for Linux (borderless) - `gamemoderun %command% -high -novid -nojoy -threads 24` or if you want fullscreen instead of borderless `gamescope -w 800 -h 600 -W 1920 -H 1080 -f -- %command% -novid -nojoy -high -threads 24`

# `-threads` parameter should be the number of CPUs including hyperthreading

## Note - install `gamescope` if missing
