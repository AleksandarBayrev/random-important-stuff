The "Rockstar Games Launcher Offline Mode" error is usually caused by corrupted local credentials or your IP address being temporarily flagged by Rockstar's security bots.

Here are the fixes, ordered from the most successful to the last resort.

Corrupted cache files often lock the launcher in offline mode. Deleting them forces the launcher to fetch fresh data.

* Close the Rockstar Games Launcher completely (check Task Manager to be sure).

* Go to your Documents folder on your PC.

* Open the Rockstar Games folder.

* Delete the Social Club folder.

* Delete the Launcher folder.

Restart the Launcher. It will ask you to log in again, which often resolves the issue.
